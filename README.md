# Introduction

The purpose of this app is to give users a convenient way to keep track of home renovations and the value of their home.

# Approach

## Design

In order to simulate a realistic workflow for a developer, I teamed up with UX designer, Casey Doan, for this project.

## Workflow

We decided on an iterative approach to developing the app. Casey would work on the designs in Figma, which allowed me to follow along and provide insight as needed. Once the design for a screen was ready, I would start translating that design to an application. Casey would then work on the next screen while providing feedback on the development.
